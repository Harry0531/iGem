                                        Modeling is to use mathematical tools to simulate and predict the system. The
                                        experiment is restricted by time and cost, which may not be comprehensive.
                                        Modeling can solve this problem by establishing mathematical system and improve
                                        the whole project. Also, the results of modeling can guide the experiment in
                                        turn, and provide clues for the selection of each material in the experiment.
                                        Last but not least, modeling can also optimize the production process when
                                        satisfying some assumptions. In our design, the overall process will be divided
                                        into two parts: cell growth part and cell production part. Our main purpose is
                                        to obtain the changes of variables concerned in this process, such as the
                                        interaction of different promoter intensity and the factors that affect the
                                        final yield. Through the detailed thinking of the whole process, we divide the
                                        whole model into the following four models:</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Promoter intensity relationship model. The model considers how the intensity of
                                        promoter which inducing LuxR affects the production during the growth process.
                                        We use the fitting method to get the relationship curve between the promoter
                                        intensity and the fluorescence intensity, and then decide which promoter should
                                        be used in the actual production.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Cell growth simulation model. In this model, we mainly consider the relationship
                                        between cell density and signal factor concentration during cell growth. In this
                                        model, we simulate the LuxR-AHL system. And because the system are related to
                                        the number of cells, we add the Logistics growth model of cells, and finally
                                        describe the relationship between the components in the growth process.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Promoter sequencing model. The purpose of this model is to adjust the sequencing
                                        of the three promoters to maximize the final yield. In this model we simplify
                                        the model to a certain extent for too many parameters. By considering the
                                        solution of the whole process in the equilibrium state, the recurrence relation
                                        of each component is obtained, and the optimal solution is achieved by
                                        enumerating.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The optimization model of the balance between production and growth. The model
                                        is used to consider the transformation of cells in growth and production
                                        condition by periodic regulation. The aim is to explore whether it is necessary
                                        to regulate and decide the regulation time when required.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        According to these four models, we has basically full consideration to the
                                        project. The establishment of the accurate numerical relationship between these
                                        quantities is great help to the experiment and even the subsequent production.

                                        In the gene pathway, we linked the gene of GFP fluorescent protein after p<sub>LuxL</sub>
                                        promoter. By giving different promoter which inducing LuxR expression and then
                                        measured the fluorescence intensity. We obtained the relationship curve between
                                        the promoter intensity and the fluorescence intensity, then the best promoter
                                        was found.</p>
                                    <h4>
                                        Model Construction:</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The promoter data of this model were derived from iGEM2006_Berkeley, where we
                                        used the fluorescence intensity in their program to characterize the promoter
                                        intensity. In this model, we choose the promoter and their intensities are as
                                        followed.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>We obtained the curve of fluorescence intensity changing with time under
                                        different promoters which inducing LuxR expression according to experiments and
                                        get the figure below. In which we averaged the data of the last 6 hours of each
                                        promoter and defined it as the corresponding average production intensity AP. We
                                        made the following scatter map of the average production intensity AP and the
                                        intensity of the promoter.</p>

                                    <p>In this figure, we can find the promoter intensity and the fluorescence intensity
                                        have an approximate linear relationship. When the promoter is stronger, and
                                        there may be more possible to have a better production. We made a linear fit

                                    <p>
                                        In this model, we got the trend of overall change between the AP and promoter
                                        intensity and made a linear fit curve to predict it. Subject to the experiment,
                                        we may not be able to get a more accurate result, but we have a promoter
                                        selection criteria: the intensity of the promoter should be higher than J23102.
                                        This is of great significance for practical production and follow-up
                                        experiments, and a further step forward to the goal of maximizing production.

                                        accurately, we added LuxR-AHL system to the model. The mode of operation is
                                        shown in the following figure. AHL is an important signal factor connecting the
                                        two systems, in which the LuxR-AHL system can produce AHL by enzyme reaction.
                                        LuxI connects the gene fragment of the production part and is responsible for
                                        starting the lycopene production.</p>

                                    <p>In this result, we can clearly see that AHL showed very low growth rate in the
                                        early stage. At a certain time, when the population density reached a certain
                                        level, AHL showed a sharp increase trend, indicating that quorum sensing has
                                        occurred. The growth rate of LuxI also began to increase suddenly, and a large
                                        number of products were produced. This result shows that our model is very
                                        consistent with the phenomenon of quorum sensing, and can be used as a
                                        mathematical description of the cell growth state in the experiment. This model

                                        P<sub>ÏƒB</sub>,P<sub>ÏƒF</sub>,P<sub>T7</sub> will lead to differences to the

                                    <p>Since ÏƒB,ÏƒF,T7 are simultaneously transcribed in genes, we can assume that the
                                        amount of these three proteins is the same, so the quantities of these three
                                        enzymes crtE, crtB and crtI is only related to their promoter intensities. The
                                        ratios of these three promoter strengths were measured by fluorescence

                                    <p> The ratio of three promoter intensities can be assumed to be the ratio of the

                                        only to keep the cell production. Therefore, our following model is to discuss
