        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transcription is the process in which genes are transformed into RNA. The resources used for transcription in each cell are limited. The resources in cells are first used to produce primary metabolites for cell growth. But most of the time our demand is secondary metabolites of cells, which requires us to reduce the competitiveness of cell growth as much as possible without affecting cell growth, and improve the competitiveness of synthetic products. When cells expand in initial stage, resources are mainly used for growth. When cells grow to an appropriate scale, more resources are used to synthesize target products.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole system is realized by utilizing resource allocation devices to enable the inhibition of cell synthesis when the cell population density is low, and then the transcriptional resources will be more used for cell growth and the cell growth will be accelerated. When the cell density is high, the transcriptional resource allocation device is activated to allocate more transcriptional resources to cell synthesis, accelerate cell synthesis without affecting the normal growth of cells, and increase the production of cell synthesis.
