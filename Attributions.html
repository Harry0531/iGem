                                    <p>As the leader of group T7, I usually arrange and supervise the experimental progress.In the early stage of iGEM, I will organize our group to hold a group meeting before each meeting, and we will discuss and study the recent literature and share our experience.This not only avoids the repeated report in the group meeting, but also urges everyone to consult the literature frequently.When it came to the experimental stage of iGEM, as the group leader, I reasonably arranged the members of our group and adopted the form of graduate students helping undergraduates to carry out the experiment in an orderly manner.</p>
                                    <p>In terms of experiment, as a team member, I actively participated in every meeting and discussed building the circuit with everyone.In practical operation, lead younger students familiar with the learning experimental process, practical operation.</p>
                                    <p>Our T7 group is a big family with unity, love and mutual help. Under such an atmosphere, our group's experiment is also going on methodically.</p>

                                    <p>The team is a group that loves each other and makes progress together. I have not only gained knowledge but also gained friendship in this team. In the team, I mainly play two roles, one is a member of the T7 group, and the second is the leader of the sponsorship group. I will describe the contribution of the team mainly from these two aspects:</p>
                                    <p style="font-weight: 700">1. T7</p>
                                    <p>In the T7 group, the preliminary work was mainly carried out in the literature research. In the literature research, I have a good cooperation with the members and  finally the design of the line was completed. In the later stage, the experimental part was mainly responsible, and the younger brothers and sisters learned the plasmid extraction, colony PCR and so on.</p>
                                    <p style="font-weight: 700">2. Sponsorship group</p>
                                    <p>As the group leader of the sponsoring group, I mainly completed the acquisition of the contact information of the previous sponsoring company, prepared the sponsoring materials, and actively contacted the company. Although the final result was not satisfactory, it also improved myself in the process.</p>
                                    <p>The ability to communicate with people enhances the ability to coordinate and work with team members.</p>
                                    <p>During this period of time in the team, I have learned a lot.It feels that it is not easy for any team to grow. Every member of the team has devoted their efforts, so that our team can thrive. Of course, many problems have also been encountered in the process of team growth. However, in the process, everyone gradually recognizes their own shortcomings and problems in the team, and can overcome difficulties. Although I have many shortcomings and shortcomings in the team, I have contributed to the overall improvement of the team, so I think I am eligible for the iGEM International Genetic Engineering Machinery Competition award.</p>

                                    <p>The work in September and October is still the connection route. Our team has completed most of the construction of PT7, P sigma B and P sigma F routes. Due to the plenty of school curriculumt，my main work is to write the wiki text. I was responsible for the significance of resource allocation in the background part. I spent most of my time looking up literatures to find appropriate research to prove the feasibility of our project and its impact.</p>
                                    <p>In writing, I made some mistakes, such as language disorders, improper wording in some places, unclear explanation of some concepts, and irregular writing of proper nouns. In particular, the overall expression may be unclear, which may easily confuse the readers. These are the questions that I usually do not pay much attention to when writing articles, and I also realize how difficult it is for the teacher to read the papers I have handed in. I need more practice in writing articles.</p>

                                    <p>This year I have moved from junior to senior, becoming an older undergraduate in this team. In this igem competition, I am in charge of the mathematical modeling. By considering the process of the whole experiment, I divided the whole experiment into two parts, cell growth part and cell production part. In these parts, according to the needs of the project, I have established four models: the relationship model between p_luxRpromoter intensity and p_luxIpromoter intensity in the growth process, the cell growth simulation model, the maximum model to optimize the arrangement of promoters in production, and the optimization model of the balance between production and growth. These models can be briefly described as follows:</p>
                                    <p>The relationship model between P<sub>luxR</sub> promoter intensity and p_luxI promoter intensity in the growth process. The model considers how the intensity of p_luxR promoter affects the production of LuxI during the growth process. We use the fitting method to get the relationship curve of the intensity of the two, and then decide which promoter should be used in the actual production.
                                        Cell growth simulation model. In this model, we mainly consider the relationship between cell density and signal factor concentration during cell growth. In this model, we consider the LuxR-AHL system. And because the system are related to the number of cells, we add the Logistics growth model of cells, and finally describe the relationship between the components in the growth process.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The maximum model to optimize the arrangement of promoters in production. The purpose of this model is to adjust the sequencing of the three promoters to maximize the final yield. In this model, because of too many parameters, we simplify the model to a certain extent. By considering the solution of the whole process in the equilibrium state, the recurrence relation of each component is obtained, and the optimal solution is achieved by enumerating.</p>
                                    <p>The optimization model of the balance between production and growth. The model is used to consider the transformation of cells in growth and production condition by periodic regulation. The aim is to explore whether it is necessary to regulate in this case and decide the regulation time. </p>
                                    <p>I have also completed the wiki of the modeling part. The modeling mechanism is described in detail. The solution results are calculated by various software, and some principle pictures are made by myself. These four parts of modeling have been able to describe the whole project process completely, and have a prospect for the future. This modeling has basically completed the task successfully, and probably enough to meet the gold medal standard of igem. </p>
                                    <p>In this project, I deeply feel the strength that the team can achieve anything. The team projects I've participated before are just small teams of two or three or four people like mathematical modeling competitions or college students' innovation and entrepreneurship projects. This is the first time a dozen people have participated in a large project. Team members coordinate their work or enable everyone to achieve the highest efficiency, which has brought me valuable experience. Although I am not a biology or chemistry major, but this experience makes me more confident in dealing with things in the future, so that I can complete other similar things more skillfully. After graduation, I may not go to the igem competition again, but I sincerely wish these brothers and sisters to go further and achieve better results in the future competition.</p>

                                    <p>In the early stage of the project, I actively conducted literature research to find meaningful and suitable subjects for iGEM. During the brainstorming, I actively put forward my idea and discussed its significance and feasibility with my teammates to provide a kind of thinking for the team.</p>
                                    <p>In terms of experiments, I was mainly involved in the work of the cell growth control and response team, designing experiments from scratch and carrying out experiments together with my teammates. In this process, I encountered many unexpected problems, and gradually solved them by consulting literature, teachers and classmates. Never thought of restructuring the carrier construction would become a big problem, from the beginning did not confirm the line began to experiment, the accuracy of the plasmid later replaced, encountered among a variety of unexpected problems, in the process of the construction of a recombinant plasmid, we tried all sorts of different ways, but the effect has not been very ideal, everyone in access to relevant information, consult the teacher elder sister, and the surrounding classmates, also to communicate and communication, and surrounding the iGEM team after the iGEM team communication and Peking University, from the two plasmids, they get in order to make full use of the two plasmids, After me and the players discuss decide to make a small change to our line, after a search information and ask the teacher our group decided to change a smaller molecular weight plasmid, god helps those who help, finally we build is successful, then in order to validate the promoter strength influence on subsequent expression, we in the iGEM's website to find the different strength of the promoter (strong, the strong and weak) to experiment, the results were surprising, promoter strength weak fluorescence intensity stronger instead, through discussion, we think LuxR may express too much hurt pLux open.</p>
                                    <p>I think the iGEM contest answers the central question in synthetic biology - whether simple biological systems can be built and manipulated in living cells using interchangeable standardized components. Each team attempts to use a standardized library of biological module components to assemble artificial biological systems for specific purposes, and to manipulate and measure them using standardized genetic engineering methods. We used our spare time to cooperate to complete the corresponding experimental work, which fully exercised our independent academic ability and teamwork ability. The competition provided an international stage for students from different countries and different majors to communicate with each other. In the process of participation, I have improved my teamwork ability, logical thinking ability, English literature reading ability and other aspects. In the last period of time, I will work together with team members to contribute to the final perfect presentation.</p>

                                    <p>Through the brain storm, the current project ATM is determined.</p>
                                    <p>In the early stage, the whole project was divided into four major directions. I was fortunate enough to join the T7 squad. After a lot of literature research and many discussions of the team members, the route we designed continued to sublimate and finally determined the ideal route.</p>
                                    <p>Based on the principle of appropriateness according to the local conditions, combined with the existing resources of the laboratory, we determined the feasibility of using the red fluorescent protein (mcherry), the chassis cell BL21 to verify our route and whether there is leakage expression in the mcherry.</p>
                                    <p>Linking the cell growth team, the team members worked together to re-plan the ideal route 1 and determine the ideal route 2. I participated in the construction of the ideal route 2, and said that the teachers and sisters completed the relevant experimental operations.</p>
                                    <p>Later, I re-planned the experimental route. I was responsible for the construction of plasmid 2. The ultimate goal of plasmid 2 was to identify the promoters of the three lycopene genes and to interface with plasmid 1 to maximize production. First, we need to verify the strength of the three promoters (PT7, PσB, PσF). In order to simplify the experiment, we chose red fluorescent protein (Mcherry) to characterize the three promoters and red fluorescent protein to plasmid pACYCDuet-1. And successfully introduced into the bottom plate cells, fermentation, and finally determined the strength of the three promoters by measuring the fluorescence expression of the three strains.</p>
                                    <p>According to the strength of the promoter, the promoter sequence in front of the three lycopene genes in plasmid 2 was determined, and finally the plasmid 1 was ligated to achieve the purpose of maximizing lycopene production.</p>

                                    <p>As a graduate student, I am mainly responsible for the design and implementation of the experiment in the BIT-China team. For the experiment, a brief description is to construct a population density sensing gene line and characterize it with a reporter gene. This is a long process of finding and building. Thanks to the help of the younger brothers and sisters in the lower grades, we were able to successfully find the components needed to build the genetic line. We had a tug-of-war with the difficulties, and the Gibson assembly failed many times, so I will come back. I tried OE, made an enzyme cut, designed the Golden Gate, and finally, after many failures, we succeeded. The construction of the gene line was only the beginning of the experiment, and in the following days, we characterized it from optimizing the conditions of shake flask fermentation to increasing the strain type. This way, the results have witnessed the growth of our group. Learn to use the iGEM website for Part Search. Design of the experimental scheme. Learning related software to design genetic lines.</p>

                                    <p>From September to October, for me, for our T7 team, it was not a good time, the early construction of the line, the construction of the T7-Mcherry line, the construction of three plasmids later, the effect is not very good, Everyone is paying time and energy for the experiment, but Gibson's assembly, OE, and enzyme-cutting connections have all been tried. It is still not very successful. What makes us feel unreasonable is the problem of sending tests. When sending PaB-Mcherry, when we first sent the test, it was the sequencing failure. We called the customer service staff. The other party gave us the answer, the bacteria could not be raised, and then we extracted the plasmid ourselves and sent the test. As a result, the other party said that there is no signal, and it is like this before and after. We tried to design short primers and tried to change the method. The result is not correct. We can only start from scratch. iGEM is a comprehensive competency competition. The competition not only cultivated my research ability and experimental technology, but also improved me in teamwork, art design and even front-end programming. I believe that iGEM provides students with a wealth of academic knowledge, comprehensive skills, opportunities and experiences to develop international horizons, and students to build an international arena that communicates and competes with the world's best professors and students. Academic and career planning is a great help. Participate in IGEM to enhance creativity (through the subject inquiry process, give full play to students' imagination and creativity); logical thinking ability (designing the subject, checking the data, implementing the method is a great test of the students' logical thinking ability); English reading and expression skills (the whole process is the original English text, students use PPT and presentation in English); improve leadership and teamwork skills (the activities use group form, need to work together to complete various learning tasks); University laboratory study certificate; those who perform well can obtain the recommendation letter from well-known professors; those who participate in the international competition remote answer can obtain the certificate of the International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition. I think iGEM is a very high-quality synthetic biology competition and an interdisciplinary, all-round competition. In 2016, 42 countries and more than 5,000 players from all over the world participated in the iGEM competition. The entire competition lasted for one year and the process began with the formation of the team. After that, our team will learn a variety of theoretical knowledge of synthetic biology, and then open up the brain, trying to solve various environmental, material, and medical problems in a synthetic biology. The process of solving the problem includes predicting experimental results and conducting experiments through mathematical modeling. We can better play the role of the project by designing hardware and software and working with the community.</p>

After a lot of knowledge accumulation, I learned some knowledge that can be used on our route, finally, together with everyone, we will form the route of our group.As the leader of the sigma factor group, work with everyone to complete the experiment carefully, reasonably arrange the task division of the team members, and analyze the problems in the experiment in time.Our group successfully constructed a preliminary route and found a fluorescent leak,we tried to do some verification experiments. During the verification process, we found that our pσB and pσF are orthogonal and do not crosstalk with the internal σ factor of E. coli. We initially think that pLUX is leaking.Actively cooperate with other teams and team leaders to complete various tasks,and present my own ideas at each group meeting and seriously discuss with my partners.Participated in the part standardization work of our group.</p>
