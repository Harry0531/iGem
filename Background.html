                                    <p>With the rapid development of modern biotechnology, fermentation engineering has made
                                    great progress in microbial breeding, biosynthesis, regulation mechanism and the
                                    development of microbial resources, which is laying a solid foundation for the emergence
                                    of the concept of cell factory. Using DNA recombination technology to construct
                                    genetically engineered bacteria to complete industrial production has become the best
                                    choice for more and more manufacturers. Genetically engineered bacteria not only have
                                    extremely low cost and very efficient output, but also can greatly improve the
                                    fermentation level of products, and can also introduce foreign genes into them to
                                    produce products that could not be produced by original engineered bacteria. It is
                                    estimated that the global market for fermented products has 12 billion to 13 billion US
                                    dollars, of which 46% are antibiotics, 16.3% are amino acids, 13.2% are organic acids,
                                        10% are enzymes and 14.5% are other fermented products [1].</p>

                                <el-collapse-item title="Why do we choose the transcriptional resource allocation?" name="2">
                                    <h4>Significance of resource allocation</h4>
                                    <p>In current methods, many strategies have been used to increase productivity of cell
                                        factories, such as transcription of genetic materials, regulation of translation, gene
                                        coupling and decoupling, alteration of metabolic pathways, changes of key enzymes, and
                                        changes of substrate concentration. But if we want cells to function differently at
                                        different times and allocate specific resources to specific genes producing target
                                        products, resources need to be allocated reasonably</p>
                                    <h4>Significance of transcriptional resource allocation</h4>
                                    <p>The application of refined cell factories to achieve Bio-Green manufacturing of energy,
                                        medicine, chemicals as well as efficient and sustainable production, requires the
                                        rational allocation of resources that can be profitable by cells. However, there are
                                        many kinds of resources that can be utilized by cells. Why do we choose to allocate
                                        transcriptional resources? Transcription is an important part of the central law and the
                                        first step in gene expression. Catalysts and enzymes are one of the decisive factors for
                                        the occurrence of intracellular metabolic reactions and their reaction rates. When the
                                        catalytic properties of the enzyme are constant, the amount of the enzyme determines the
                                        reaction rate. The amount of enzymes depend on the transcription and translation of
                                        cells. Here, we define transcription resources as substrates (nucleotides, etc.)
                                        directly involved in transcription and substances (transcription factors, RNA
                                        polymerase, etc.) that assist in transcription. In refined cell factories, the amount of
                                        transcriptional resources available to cells is limited, and we need to make efficient
                                        use of them. The production model we designed is that cells grow at a high speed in the
                                        prophase, and transcriptional resources are allocated to the metabolism of cell growth.
                                        When the number and size of cell factories grow to the appropriate scale, the focus of
                                        transcriptional resource allocation shifts from cell growth to cell production. It is a
                                        kind of new cell factory with high intelligence and refinement. Such cell factory can
                                        minimize the consumption of resources needed for their own growth and accelerate their
                                        growth during the growth period, while most of the resources are used to synthesize
                                        target products during the production period, thus saving resources and increasing
                                        production. For industrial production, our transcription resource allocation system can
                                        also save costs and efficiently produce more target products.</p>

                                    <h4>Quorum sensing</h4>
                                    <p>Bacteria can sense the concentration changes of a small molecular weight chemical
                                        signaling molecule secreted by other bacteria growing with them in the growing
                                        environment. This phenomenon is called Quorum Sensing (QS), which can promote the
                                        communication between bacterial individuals and coordinate the behavior of groups. These
                                        signaling molecules secreted by bacteria can regulate their biological behavior, so they
                                        are called self-inducible factors. Once the concentration of self-inducible factor
                                        reaches a certain threshold, the quorum sensing will activate or inhibit the expression
                                        of some target genes, thus regulating the biological behavior of bacteria. Quorum
                                        sensing is involved in regulating various biological behaviors of bacteria, such as
                                        bioluminescence, cell membrane formation, cell differentiation, extracellular
                                        polysaccharide formation, exercise, antibiotic production, etc[2].</p>
                                    <p>The QS signaling molecule of Gram-negative bacteria is also known as autoinducer (AI1).
                                        AHLs consist of a conservative hydrophobic head of the homoserine lactone ring and a
                                        variable hydrophilic tail of the amide side chain, which determines the diversity of
                                        AHLs. The differences between AHLs are mainly reflected in the presence or absence of
                                        side chains of amides, the difference of substituted groups (hydrogen, hydroxyl or
                                        carbonyl) at the third carbon atom of amides, and the presence or absence of one or more
                                        unsaturated bonds in side chains. The difference of AHLs is formed by the acyl side
                                        chains of different acyl carrier proteins bound by homoserine in the synthesis process.
                                        The difference of AHLs is due to the combination of homoserine with acyl side chains of
                                        different acyl carrier proteins in the synthesis process. AHLs have short amide side
                                        chains that allow them to pass passively into and out of bacterial cell wall. This is
                                        different from AHLs and AIP (signal molecules of Gram-positive bacteria) with long amide
                                        side chains, which cross bacterial cell membranes through an active transport
                                        mechanism.</p>
                                    <p>LuxI and LuxR proteins are involved in quorum sensing in most gram-negative bacteria.
                                        LuxI protein is an autoinducer synthase, which can synthesize signal molecules AHLs.
                                        LuxR protein is an autoinducer receptor in cytoplasm and also a transcription activating
                                        element. When AHLs diffuse to extracellular space, they accumulate with the increase of
                                        cell density. When this signal density accumulates to the critical density, they bind to
                                        LuxR. The combined complex can activate gene transcription. With the proliferation of
                                        AHLs outside the cell, its density also accumulates with the increase of cell density.
                                        When the density of this signal molecule accumulates to the critical density, it binds
                                        to LuxR. And the binding complex can activate gene transcription. Since LuxR protein
                                        only binds to specific AHLs, LuxI / LuxR system is also mainly used for intraspecific
                                        quorum sensing. However, LuxR protein that bind several AHLs have been reported. For
                                        example, Salmonella SdiA protein are mainly related to bacterial interspecific
                                        induction[3].</p>

                                    <h4>σ factor expression system and T7 expression system</h4>
                                    <p>σ factor and core enzymes are the components of RNA polymerase. σ factor itself can’t
                                        initiate transcription, but can specifically tow RNA polymerase to specific promoter
                                        binding sites. The σ factor expression system has the advantages of no cytotoxicity and
                                        no leaked expression, and it has many optional promoters and a wide range of gene
                                        expression intensity.</p>
                                    <p>T7 RNA polymerase-dominated transcription is very active. RNA polymerase-driven
                                        transcription in host cells can not compete with T7 RNA polymerase. Almost all
                                        transcription in cells occurs rapidly due to the activation of T7 RNA polymerase.</p>

                                    <h4>Lycopene</h4>
                                    <p>Lycopene, also known as ψ-carotene, belongs to isoprene compounds. Lycopene is a kind of
                                        non-circular planar polyunsaturated fatty hydrocarbon. Its molecular structure formula
                                        contains 11 conjugated double bonds and 2 non-conjugated double bonds. Lycopene is the
                                        most effective antioxidant in carotenoids. It regulates the metabolism of cholesterol
                                        and has the functions of anti-cancer and improving immunity. Lycopene is widely used in
                                        health food, medicine and cosmetics.</p>

                                    <p>Firstly, compared with the high density culture technology commonly used in industry, it
                                        is no longer necessary to monitor the bacterial density in the tank in real time, which
                                        reduces the cost of technology[5]. Instead of adding inducers from outside, T7 and σ
                                        factors expression system can induce the distribution of transcriptional resources from
                                        growth to production, which saves labor costs and huge costs of large-scale use of
                                        inducers in industrial production . Compared with the two-stage fermentation method,
                                        which regulates the growth of engineering bacteria to appropriate density and then
                                        starts to synthesize products by adjusting oxygen input, our strategy does not require
                                        the production of target products through anaerobic fermentation stage[6], and does not
                                        need to change the gas environment in the production stage. It’s more convenient. </p>
                                    <p>Secondly, our strain can utilize industrial materials more efficiently, achieve the best
                                        balance in growth rate and production rate, increase the production of target products,
                                        avoids the inhibition of metabolic byproduct on recombinant cells, and reduces the

                                    <p>If the allocation of transcriptional resources can be achieved to the extreme, the
                                        secondary metabolites in cells will only be our target products. Resources will be more
                                        concentrated on the target products, which will further improve efficiency and further
                                        reduce the waste of resources.</p>

                                    <p>Our iGEM project this year can also be used as a standardized component for technical
                                        integration with previous iGEM projects. That is to say, we hope to integrate the
                                        various functions implemented in previous iGEM projects, such as microorganism
                                        intelligent response and regulation of temperature, pH and redox state (I'M HeRE, 2013,
                                        pH controller, 2015, who can get an A, 2018), intelligent protection of engineering
                                        bacteria technical safety (E.co-Lock, 2014), and automatic elimination of low-yield
                                        engineering bacteria (P-SLACKiller, 2016), in order to achieve a more intelligent and
                                        refined cell factory, further energy saving and emission reduction and increase
                                        production.</p>
                                    <p>In the application of industrial production, our engineering bacteria can be further
                                        domesticated to adapt to the industrial production of large fermenter environment, and
                                        then applied to industrial production. We can increase the negative feedback system to
                                        improve the stability of the system. According to the different rates and environments
                                        required for industrial production, we can change or mutagenesis based on the sequence
                                        library of T7 and σ factors, and modify the critical density of strain for switching
                                        between growth and production, in order to meet the production needs of different
                                        products. According to the different target products needed in industrial production, we
                                        can change the key enzyme sequence after T7 and σ expression system to produce other
                                        industrial products besides lycopene and hope this strategy more widely used in
                                        production</p>
