                                                  name="1">
                                    <p>The Research Institute of Nutrition and Health of China Food Group Co., Ltd. is
                                        the first enterprise-oriented research center in China to systematically study
                                        the nutritional needs and metabolic mechanism of Chinese people in order to
                                        realize the health needs of Chinese people. The BIT-China team came to the
                                        Institute of Nutrition and Health of COFCO for an exchange meeting on July 26,
                                        2019.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        We visited the Institute of Nutrition and Health of China Food and Agriculture
                                        to understand its strong scientific research strength and recognize each other's
                                        professionalism. We introduced our project to the researchers of the institute,
                                        including team history, project background, project design, modeling design and
                                        project significance. They asked some questions about the project, pointed out
                                        the shortcomings (such as simple circuit design, wide application of quorum
                                        sensing system, etc.) and put forward corresponding guidance. We asked them how
                                        they could convert laboratory products into products that could be produced on a
                                        large scale in factories, and raised some questions in ordinary industrial
                                        production processes (such as common fermentation methods, cost ratio of
                                        inducers, factors affecting industrial production output, etc.) as well as the
                                        current market situation of lycopene.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        COFCO Nutrition and Health Research Institute is also conducting research on
                                        nutritional products, and as a research and development center with enterprises
                                        as the main body, its researchers have unique and refined views on how to
                                        transform laboratory products into industrial mass-produced products. Their
                                        opinions and answers are of great help to the design and improvement of our
                                        project. After the meeting, we realized the current shortcomings of the project
                                        and the corresponding improvement direction, and carried out more in-depth
                                        thinking to make it more perfect. At the same time, our introduction also
                                        provides some new ideas and inspiration for the staff of the Institute of
                                        Nutrition and Health of COFCO.

                                        As did every other team, we presented our designs and the progress we’d made by
                                        then to other teams. We made an analogy as a lead-in story for others’ better
                                        understanding of our objectives. We also shared our design of utilizing quorum
                                        sensing and T7 promotor as two parts of our system. And as a matter of fact,
                                        modeling is part that other teams were most intrigued in. Besides, we proposed
                                        our final goal of constructing an intellectual cell factory, combining our
                                        projects from past few years. Moreover, we learned a great lot from other teams
                                        who had partial same goal as we did and who also made ingenious proposal of
                                        various methods.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        After presentation, we had sufficient time for exchanging ideas with other
                                        teams, which enriched our understanding of many technological methodologies and
                                        gained us further view of our own design. We had fruitful discussion with teams
                                        who had innovative thoughts for solving their problems and our shared problems.
                                        And yet new challenges were also generated from those conversations. It’s always
                                        a pleasant time as we proposed rushing ideas and tried to fit them into future
                                        views.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        It’s, no doubt, a great fortune to us that we found people who had
                                        ingeniously-designed parts that would work perfectly for our purpose too. And
                                        it’s even a greater joy that we also had something they wanted all along. For
                                        such reasons we build collaborations with other teams and looked forward to
                                        working together in the very soon future. It’s also a great honor that we had a
                                        very knowledgable iGem Ambassador, Dorothy Zhang, in Beijing meeting. Based on
                                        our presentation, she gave us earnest advice, on presenting our ideas and on
                                        developing our thoughts.

                                        T7 strength is not high enough to express the rate-limiting enzyme, and audience
                                        made many suggestions for the design.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In response to the controversy over the strength of the T7 promoter, we have
                                        consulted various data. We believe that the "domesticated" T7 promoter in the
                                        laboratory is still strong enough to express enough rate-limiting enzymes.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In design, we consider the suggestions by other teams. We decided to divide the
                                        all genes into two and build it on the “control plasmid” and the “production
                                        plasmid”.

                                    <p> Our team's member Fang returned to his alma mater, Nanling Middle School in the
                                        countryside during the summer vacation. There are many children living a hard
                                        life, but they dream of going to college and becoming scientists. Fang delivered
                                        a brief speech, mainly about his college life and the iGEM competition. He
                                        introduced synthetic biology to high school students with his high school
                                        knowledge. Fang said, "Although they can't fully understand it, they think it's
                                        interesting and maybe one day they will take part in the iGEM competition. "</p>

                                        In China, biology is considered a difficult profession to find a job, so it is
                                        difficult for them to get their parents to agree to study biology in university.
                                        And our public education is to change this situation and let biological
                                        knowledge penetrate into these economically underdeveloped areas.

                                    <p>On August 6, BIT-China 2019 was honored to host the iGEM Meetup in Beijing.</p>
                                    <p> Beijing is not only the capital of China, but also the academic and cultural
                                        center.
                                        There are a large number of top iGEM teams in China. Frontier and amazing ideas
                                        and
                                        projects are blooming here. This meeting contributes to the collaboration and
                                        communication of the iGEM community.</p>
                                    <p>Thanks for the participation of these teams, <a

                                    <p>We learned a lot from the Meetup. From the instructor of the Peking University
                                        team, we
                                        learned that there were some problems in the design of the experiment, and the
                                        project
                                        was not smart enough. We conducted a survey on this and proposed the design of
                                        the
                                        negative feedback circuit. We also discussed the improvement suggestions based
                                        on his
                                        suggestions, and determined the scheme of the control group. The fluorescence
                                        characterization was
                                        compared with the experimental group to improve our project.</p>
                                    <p>In the future, we plan to produce lycopene to verify the our work and discuss the
                                        relationship with the astaxanthin line of China Agricultural University to
                                        promote
                                        exchanges
                                        and cooperation in Beijing.</p>

                                    <h2>Research Background</h2>
                                <p>Our team is a team with a history of seven years.
                                    After the completion of each year's competition,
                                    some members complete their mission and retire with honor.
                                    Some members inherit their mission and continue to stay in the team.
                                    Many new members join the team with vision and dream. Year after year, member
                                    s come and go and different faces shuttle in the laboratory, but Bit-China has no
                                    t changed and continues to move forward.</p>
                                <p>This year, when we sought collaboration, we found that many of the teams of the past years have disappeared,
                                    while others have kept strong. This makes us realize that, like the law of the rise and fall of the dynasty,
                                    every team may experience the process of building a team, going to the peak, and then gradually declining.
                                    At the same time, we find that every year there are some common problems in our team, but due to the frequent
                                    flow of members within the team, we are not paid attention to and solved them in time. Are these common problems hidden
                                    dangers that affect our team? We start to think about: How many years will our own team last? What are the factors that affect the continued existence of a team?
                                </p>
                                <p>The PI told us that the core of the project is the team.
                                    We agree with this point of view, and believe that team building and inheritance are
                                    the key factors that affect the existence of a team. The core and foundation of the project is not the project itself
                                    but the team and people who participate in the project, guide the project and implement the project. Only by building
                                    a team with tacit cooperation and dedication can team members complete a wonderful scientific research project more efficiently and actively.</p>
                                <p>We have been thinking about how the iGEM team can smoothly and quickly carry out the new and old inheritance,
                                    so as to improve the scientific research technology of the team members and the coordination and cooperation between the team members,
                                    strengthen the team members' understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM, complete the construction of the whole project and carry out public science education better.</p>
                                <p>This year, our team designed a questionnaire on how the iGEM team inherits the team and the team members'
                                    understanding of synthetic biology and iGEM. Our survey is not aimed at specific problems in the project,
                                    but at the problems of the team, so as to improve the project.
                                </p>
                                <p>This is very helpful and meaningful for other teams and iGEM's own construction.</p>
                                <p>Only every iGEM team can create a harmonious team atmosphere with high efficiency and good communication,
                                    each team can complete high-quality projects, and iGEM can continue to develop and achieve a win-win situation.</p>

                                    <h2>Results</h2>
                                <p>We collected 50 questionnaires with 40 Chinese iGEM teams participating. The results are as follows:</p>
                                    <p>At the beginning of each member join the team, most members
                                        learn the related scientific research knowledge through the introduction and
                                        guidance of the former members and the internal materials of the team, and many
                                        members will take the initiative to find various materials for learning, among which communication
                                        with the previous members is considered to be the most commonly used and helpful learning method,
                                        while most team members think that the instructor demonstration is not helpful, and will not take the initiative to ask the instructor.</p>

                                    <p>We are glad to see that most of the members think that iGEM experience has a great help to their study and life,
                                        and 52% of the members are willing to participate in the next iGEM competition, but only 15% of the
                                        members of a team are willing to stay.<a href="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/9/9b/T--BIT-China--resource_hp_the_questionnaire.xlsx">[Please check questionnaire details Question 8]</a>We can also know
                                        that the time is the most important factor to limit the number of people staying in the team by analyzing
                                        the description of the members who are not willing to stay . </p>

                                    <p>What’s worse, most teams don't have effective ways to motivate their team members to stay.</p>
                                    <img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/4/49/T--BIT-China--resource_Team_hp_1-4.png">
                                    <p>At the same time, there are many common problems in the team.
                                        The most prominent is the phenomenon of unequal division of labor and
                                        that the team members have not seriously completed the work.
                                        The second is that the experiment can not be completed as expected and the internal communication of the team.
                                        t is worth noting that the time arrangement is easy to conflict with the learning time, spending a lot of extra time
                                        on repetitive or meaningless things and the team will not play its due effect. Through the description of the respondents,
                                        we can see that many hidden dangers lie in that the team members did not learn systematically when they first joined the team, and they could not reach good communication.
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b5/T--BIT-China--resource_Team_hp_1-5.png">
                                    <p>We are most concerned about the inheritance of each team. It's nice to see that 64% of the teams pay attention to
                                        the importance of inheritance, and will keep the information in the whole competition process so that the next
                                        team members can better enter the competition state, but 26% of the teams don't pay attention to the inheritance
                                        of the team, and even a few teams won't provide the information to the next members.</p>

                                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>This survey is very meaningful. It not only makes us realize the problems existing in the team,
                                    such as the instructor can’t really provide helpful guidance in all aspects,
                                    the importance of equal division of labor and communication in the team, the urgency of team training, etc.,
                                    but also lets us know the direction of team improvement and what needs special attention when building the team later.</p>
                                    <p>In this survey, we also asked each team member whether they thought there were any unreasonable or
                                        inapplicable parts in the iGEM competition system. Some of them thought that one year's competition time
                                        was too short to complete a good project, the kit box was sent too slowly, the pure software team was too few,
                                        many experimental teams completed the production of software at the same time and so on. We hope that our survey will help build a better iGEM.</p>
                                    <p>We share the results of this survey with all iGEM teams.
                                        We hope that this survey can help other teams think about whether there are similar inheritance
                                        problems in their own teams, so that team managers can improve the internal construction of the team,
                                        constantly improve team members' abilities through iGEM competitions, and continuously cultivate the elites who can make contribution to the society and the world. </p>
